## Congrats
Thanks for helping the newbies, I wish I had had this my first time around.

## Recommendations
Although your images *do* contain alts, they are not a proper indication for a disabled user for what to do. 
As such, I will open another Pull Request to help with that. 
Also, I am not visually impaired but I happen to be tired now so the images were not clear. Another PR soon.
